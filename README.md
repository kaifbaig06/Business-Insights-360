**Company Background:**
AtliQ Hardware sells computers and accessories through retailers and direct distributors worldwide. They recently faced unexpected losses in their American store due to decisions based on surveys, intuition, and limited Excel analysis. To compete better, the company needs to build an analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions.

**Project Outcome:**
This project aims to clarify the purpose and goals of the data analytics initiative. The report generated will enable data-driven decision-making and answer numerous questions about the company's performance. It's a step towards surviving and thriving in the industry.
